# label_masking
A new method to use multi-head attention heads for sequence labeling 
This repository contains the notebook of the code used for SEMEVAL 2020 Task 5: Detecting Counterfactuals
The code ranked 2nd. It works competetively with some more intricate models like ALBERT and RoBERTa.
The innovation of the model is in using multi-stage multi-head attention mehtod on top of BERT. The method can be extended to some other sequence labeling task.
